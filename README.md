# Bissonnette-Portfolio

MSPPM Candidate at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University – Developing GIS content for advanced GIS course. I am particularly nterested in public health and environment applications of GIS, leveraging it to increase stakeholder knowledge of pressing local health and environment related issues. 

# About me

I believe Geographic Information Systems are some of the most compelling tools for communicating and analyzing data. From experience, GIS platforms have enabled me to persuasively present marine ecology, climate change research, and food security data for internal and external uses. Around the coast of Vancouver Island, my colleagues and I mapped kelp distributions to better understand the local ecosystem's ability to support seasonal harvests of bull kelp. Researching alternate wet dry irrigation, I and my peers geospatially mapped the relationship between soil saturation and methane emmisions in rice paddies. Finally, at St. Mary's Food Bank we used GIS in various contexts to analyze our impact for different stakeholder groups throughout Arizona. In each case, it has helped contextualize broader research themes and findings to a place or region.

# What I hope to learn

Owing most of my GIS knowledge to professional experience, I'm hoping to broaden my knowledge and ability to apply it to new work. In particular, I'm interested in workflows that will help me systematically tackle and adapt to new problems. Additionally, I would like to explore new ways of presenting geographic data via web platforms and story maps –both for the general public and peers. Finally, I want to further build on my programmatic knowledge, utilizing python's API to pull, analyze, and render new data automatically. As a whole, I'm open to learning pretty much anything since it is such a fascinating tool.
