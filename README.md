# Bissonnette-Portfolio

MSPPM Candidate at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University â€“ Developing GIS content for advanced GIS course. Interested in public health and environment application of GIS.

# About me

I find Geographic Information Systems as one of the most compelling tools for communicating and analyzing data. From experience, GIS platforms have enabled me to persuasively present marine ecology, climate change research, and food security data for internal and external uses. In each case, it has helped contextualize broader research themes to a place or region.

# What I hope to learn

Owing most of my GIS knowledge to professional experience, I'm hoping to broaden my knowledge and ability to apply it to new work. In particular, I'm interested in workflows that will help me systematically tackle new problems. I also want to further build on my programmatic knowledge, utilizing python's API to pull, analyze, and render new data automatically. As a whole, I'm open to learning pretty much anything since I find it such a fascinating tool.
