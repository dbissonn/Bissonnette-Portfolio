## Project Design Summary

The design process for GreenWave's map was largely based on their mission and online branding. Extensive research on the organization and their branding was conducted to capture key mission goals and recurring design themes. Taking a cue from the organization's focus on extending information and resources on sustainable ocean farming, the design choices of this map convey their goal to grow the industry of regenerative ocean farming, yielding economic and climatic benefits. Building on this, greens, yellows, and blues were chosen to symbolize their efforts in growing sustainable businesses, and spreading its practices. These color choices also mirror their branding that is suffuse with images of ocean crops, the sea, and fishermen. The flow of research, ideation, design, and synthesis is outlined in the below process list. To effectively and accurately represent GreenWave, this map is heavily synthesized from their online branding, values, and media.
